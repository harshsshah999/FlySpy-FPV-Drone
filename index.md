## About the Project

This project was developed by the **FlySpy** group as part of the **Master‚Äôs Project ‚Äì Intelligent Systems (SS2025)** at **Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences**.

### üéØ Objective  
Investigate and document **cost-effective, AI-enabled drones** suitable for teaching, research, and real-world reconnaissance.

### üß© Project Scope  
1. **Build** a low-cost 5-inch FPV drone  
2. **Integrate** a real-time AI application (e.g., human detection)  
3. **Explore** autopilot capabilities and delivery mechanisms  
4. **Document** the process with clear reproducibility  
5. **Design** for modularity and future scaling with ease

## Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Setup
- Assemble frame, mount motors, ESCs, and FC
- Connect ELRS receiver and smoke stopper
- Power with 3‚Äì6S LiPo battery
- Use goggles with AV-out for FPV (e.g., Skyzone Cobra X V4)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Firmware Configuration
- Flash Betaflight or ArduPilot onto F405 AIO
- Configure receiver, video settings, and motor direction
- Tune PID, failsafe, and flight modes as needed

---

### üì∫ Viewing the FPV Stream on Mac
- RCA video output from goggles ‚Üí RCA to USB capture card ‚Üí MacBook
- View stream using QuickTime or OBS with UVC input

## AI Integration

### üéØ Goal
Enable **human detection in live video** to simulate surveillance/reconnaissance capability.

### üîß Pipeline
- **Input:** FPV feed via USB capture card
- **Model:** YOLOv5 with Ultralytics (Python)
- **Output:** Real-time bounding boxes drawn on video stream

### üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard
We built a simple Python + HTML/CSS dashboard to:
- Show live stream in browser
- Highlight detected humans in real time

```bash
python3 -m venv v; source v/bin/activate
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
python yolov5_realtime.py
